Hi! Welcome to New Life! This is obviously heavily inspried by Grian's various life series, so I'd like to give credit where it's due.
If you're looking for insctruction on how to set up a New Life game, head to https://mc.kayt.dev/datapacks/new-life.
If you're looking to poke around in the code, carry on!

If you're looking for the book and totem JSON, check out data/new_life/functions/debug/
The life tracking is in data/new_life/functions/check_lives.mcfunction and data/new_life/functions/update_lives.mcfunction
The sacrifice code is naturally in data/new_life/functions/sacrifice.mcfunction
There's also the original command block chains I came up wtih in third-life-command-blocks.txt

If there's errors or you've got suggestions send me a message over on Twitter, @kayt_was_taken, or Tumblr, kayt-was-taken, (I'm *much* more likely to see it if it's on tumblr)
